# **AGrow-ML**

We are given the monthly production quantity for a certain agricultural product in 10 different provinces of a country between January 2015 to December 2020. This product comes from a fruit. It takes a few months for the fruits to grow on the trees which bear them. It also takes a few days to extract the syrup from the fruits after they have been harvested. 

## We would like to predict the production quantity from Jan 2021 to Dec 2021. 

### Data: 
          
* Production Quantity.csv has 4 columns

* Eight Day NDVI.csv: has 4 columns
  * start_date, end_date: start day and end day at 8-day frequency between Dec 27, 2013 to Mar 13, 2022. 
  * ndvi: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI is a ratio which ranges between [-1, 1] and captures the vegetation abundance of an area) at 8 day frequency between the given periods
  * region_id: A unique identifier for the 10 provinces 

* predicted_production_qty.csv: has 4 columns 
  * start_date, end_date: start day and end day of each month between Jan 2021 to Dec 2021. 
  * prod: This column needs to be filled by the candidate with their predictions of Grople syrup. 
  * region_id: A unique identifier for the 10 provinces 

**Evaluation:** 
The model will be evaluated using 
* MAPE: Mean Absolute Percentage Error between the prediction values and ground
* truth R2: Coefficient of determination between the prediction values and ground truth
